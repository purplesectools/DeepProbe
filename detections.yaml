        title: Suspicious commands in Bash history
        narrative: "Commands that are often associated with malicious activities (e.g., downloading tools, deleting logs, privilege escalation attempts) were found in the user's Bash command history. This suggests a user, or an attacker using a user's account, has performed suspicious actions on the system."
